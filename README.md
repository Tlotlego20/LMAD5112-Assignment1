The purpose of the app 

The purpose of the app is to create a special Android mobile application that compares users' ages to famous figures from history. It's designed by Sarah, an avid history buff and educator, to inspire young minds by using technology. The objective is to make the app educational and fun for students by allowing them to input their age and see how it compares to the age of various historical figures when they passed away. A 

 

Design-Related Issues 

User-Friendly Interface: To enable users to access and update meeting details quickly, the application's interface should be simple to use and intuitive. 

 Management of Meeting Details: Users should be able to enter and edit the date, time, location, attendees, agenda, and meeting notes—among the other crucial meeting details—through the app. 

 

Data Security: To safeguard private meeting information, put strong data encryption and security procedures in place. 

 Notification System: Including a notification system in the system to inform users of impending meetings, scheduling modifications, or new invites to meetings. 

 Reporting Functionality: Produce thorough reports that include an overview of the meeting's attendance, contents, and action items. 

 Scalability: Create an application that can grow with the number of users and meetings in an efficient manner. 

 

 

Utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions 

Version control with Git and GitHub: Git and GitHub can be used for version control, which enables the simultaneous work of several developers on a project. This guarantees the integrity of the code, makes code reviews easier, and makes rollbacks simple when necessary. 

Collaboration and Issue Tracking: You can coordinate tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress throughout the development lifecycle with GitHub's collaboration capabilities, which include issue tracking and project boards.  

 GitHub Actions should be implemented for automated Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This covers deployment to staging and production environments, code quality checks, and automated testing.  

Utilize GitHub's pull request feature to conduct code reviews and make sure that all changes are examined, accepted, and merged in accordance with coding standards and best practices. 

Documentation and Wiki: Make use of GitHub's wiki and documentation tools to record project specifications, installation instructions, API documentation, and troubleshooting manuals.
